    "### A. Illness-Based Absence Policy (Face-to-Face Classes)\n",
    "If at any time during the semester you are ill, in the interest of your own health and safety as well as the health and safety of your instructors and classmates, you are encouraged not to attend face-to-face class meetings or events.  Please review the steps outlined below that you should follow to ensure your absence for illness will be excused.  These steps also apply to not participating in synchronous online class meetings if you feel too ill to do so and missing specified assignment due dates in asynchronous online classes because of illness.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If you are ill and think the symptoms might be COVID-19-related:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Call Student Health Services at 806.743.2848 or your health care provider.  During after-hours and on weekends, contact TTU COVID-19 Helpline at TBD.\n",
    "    2. Self-report as soon as possible using the Dean of Students COVID-19 webpage. This website has specific directions about how to upload documentation from a medical provider and what will happen if your illness renders you unable to participate in classes for more than one week.\n",
    "    3. If your illness is determined to be COVID-19-related, all remaining documentation and communication will be handled through the Office of the Dean of Students, including notification of your instructors of the time you may be absent from and may return to classes.\n",
    "    4. If your illness is determined not to be COVID-19-related, please follow steps 2.a-d below.\n",

If your illness renders you unable to attend face-to-face classes, participate in synchronous online classes, or miss specified assignment due dates in asynchronous online classes, you are encouraged to contact either Student Health Services at 806.743.2848 or your health care provider.  Note that Student Health Services and your own and other health care providers may arrange virtual visits.\n",

    "Following the steps outlined above helps to keep your instructors informed about your absences and ensures your absence or missing an assignment due date because of illness will be marked excused.  You will still be responsible to complete within a week of returning to class any assignments, quizzes, or exams you miss because of illness.\n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Illness-Based Absence Policy (Telepresence Classes)\n",
    "Same as above with respect potential to infect others; go to a health care provider if you are ill.  Telepresence courses are recorded and will be available on TTU MediaSite and/or YouTube (unlisted).

    "## Academic Integrity Statement:\n",
    "Academic integrity is taking responsibility for one’s own class and/or course work, being individually accountable, and demonstrating intellectual honesty and ethical behavior.  Academic integrity is a personal choice to abide by the standards of intellectual honesty and responsibility.  Because education is a shared effort to achieve learning through the exchange of ideas, students, faculty, and staff have the collective responsibility to build mutual trust and respect.  Ethical behavior and independent thought are essential for the highest level of academic achievement, which then must be measured.  Academic achievement includes scholarship, teaching, and learning, all of which are shared endeavors.  Grades are a device used to quantify the successful accumulation of knowledge through learning.  Adhering to the standards of academic integrity ensures grades are earned honestly.  Academic integrity is the foundation upon which students, faculty, and staff build their educational and professional careers.  [Texas Tech University (“University”) Quality Enhancement Plan, Academic Integrity Task Force, 2010].\n",

    "## Religious Holy Day Statement: \n",
    "“Religious holy day” means a holy day observed by a religion whose places of worship are exempt from property taxation under Texas Tax Code §11.20.  A student who intends to observe a religious holy day should make that intention known to the instructor prior to the absence.  A student who is absent from classes for the observance of a religious holy day shall be allowed to take an examination or complete an assignment scheduled for that day within a reasonable time after the absence.  A student who is excused may not be penalized for the absence; however, the instructor may respond appropriately if the student fails to complete the assignment satisfactorily.\n",

    "## Ethical Conduct Policy:\n",
    "Cheating is prohibited, and the representation of the work of another person as your own will be grounds for receiving a failing grade in the course.\n"
