    "## What is Modeling?\n",
    "\n",
    "Modeling is the art of representing reality in a simplified form, sufficient to answer questions about that reality\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a Model?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many definitions, a few are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A model is a simplification of reality that duplicates the excitation-response of the real system but is faster, smaller, or more practical to study than the real system.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. A mathematical model is composed of mathematical expressions quantifying fundamental physical principles (force, energy, mass, etc.). These expressions are adapted and simplified in each case to the special features of the problem to be tackled.\n",
    "3. A model is any device that represents an approximation of a field situation.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several categories of models: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Physical models** such as laboratory sand tanks, flumes, pipe networks, porous columns, batch reactors, and pilot plants are used to directly simulate various conditions anticipated in full scale settings. Physical models tend to be the most costly to build from scratch, but many questions cannot be answered without these kind of model\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Analog models** such as electric circuit analogs or Hele-Shaw analogs are used to indirectly simulate field conditions by direct simulation in a domain analogous to the real setting.  Analog computers are quite rare today, but in the 1960's were a principal tool in modeling and were used in aerospace as well as mundane civil engineering applications. A laboratory mouse used to test medicine doses (usually for lethality) is an example of an analog model for human testing. Bear (1972), Chapter 11 provides an excellent background on analog models. The treatment is mostly aimed at porous medium flow, but the concepts are generic. The book has some nice photographs of electric-analog computers (which are rare today).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Mathematical models** indirectly simulate field conditions by solution of a governing equation thought to represent the system, along with auxiliary equations that describe the boundary and forcing conditions. These physics and chemical relationships are represented as sets of algebraic equations. Conversion from physics to the computer is via finite-difference, finite-element, finite-volume analysis. Particle tracking is an alternate approach. Mathematical models are solved analytically or numerically -- both solutions may require a computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The set of commands used to solve a mathematical problem on a computer is the program or code. \n",
    "    - The code is generic, whereas a model is comprised of boundary and initial conditions, a computational grid, material properties on that grid, and forcing terms. \n",
    "    - Thus a model is **both** the data and code, whereas the code alone is just a tool waiting for use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another kind of model is a statistical (or data model) model that relates observations to excitations without necessarily attempting to relate underlying physics of the problem (Machine Learning; Neural Networks, Regression Trees, Support Vector Machines are these kind of models). \n",
    "\n",
    "All the kinds of models are useful and appropriate tools in their various applications."
