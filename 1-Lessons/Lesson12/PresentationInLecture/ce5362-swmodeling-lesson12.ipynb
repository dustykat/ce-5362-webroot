    "A branched system can be conceptualized as 1-D spatial cases that have some common junctions. \n",
    "At these junctions the usual approach is to require conservation of stage (water surface cannot have two different elevations at a single point) - which is essentially stating that energy is unique at a section. \n",
    "\n",
    "If the junction has some finite \"size\", we would have to specify energy or momentum conservation (HEC-RAS takes this approach); in my opinion its more sensible to let the junction be infinetsimal and handle the resulting losses in the immediate downstream link.\n",
